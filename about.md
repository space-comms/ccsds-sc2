# Proximity-1 
- A control system where the vehicle controller configures and monitors a protocol stack; the protocol stack uses variables, directives, COP-P,
 supervisory PDUs, MIB parameters, physical link to move data reliably and to report status and problems back up

## Vehicle controller
- on-board computer / mission logic that decides how to use the link
- sends local directives, configures MIB parameters to control the link, receives notifications describing link state and events

## Notifications to vehicle controller
- management indications generated by MAC/COP-P
- inform the controller about success/failure of resync, timers underflowing, abnormal half-duplex behavior, carrier loss etc..

## MAC / Session & State Control (link "brain")
- state control variables
  - defines the high-level operational state of the proximity link
- operational control variables
  - working state used by MAC and Data Services to decide what to send and how to interpret events

## Elements & events that affect state
- events and timing mechanisms that trigger state transitions and notifications

## directives
- local directives from vehicle controller
  - write or query MAC state and operational variables, and indirectly the MIB
- remote directives via SPDUs
  - embedded in supervisory PDUs, decoded by MAC, and used to reconfigure the local stack

## duplex/simplex operations & physical interfaces
- duplex/simplex operations
  - defines how MAC schedules send/receive given DUPLEX state and timers 
- interfaces with physical layer and sending/receiving operations
  - procedural glue between MAC, Data Services, physical modem

## supervisory PDUs & variable-length fields
- variable-length supervisory protocol data field formats
  - provide the on-wire format for control-plane information:
  - local/remote directives, status reports, PLCWs, etc... between two MAC/Data services entities

## COP-P
- reliable transport engine on top of the frame service

## MIB (Management Information Base)
- local configuration database of parameters (durations, timeouts, window sizes, resync parameters, hailing settings, persistenc times)
  - MAC stores and distributes the MIB parameters; directives update the MIB parameters; COP-P reads the MIB parameters 
- only parameter values; no frames or PDUs

## physical layer & coding & sync
- frame/ coding & sync
- physical layer
- actual radio link over which all user data and supervisory/control information flows

Directives

local 
- control commands that tell the MAC/protocol processor how to configure and operate
- local directives (function calls / commands from the vehicle controller to the local MAC)

remote
- control commands carried over the link to the other like the local directives
- carried inside SPDUs

SPDU
- used to control or report status to the remote partnered transceiver
- inside SPDU
  - directives (local when generated, remote when received at the far side)
  - plcw (proximity link control words) 
  - status reports (protocol reports)
- the spdu sits inside a frame; inside the SPDU are directives, PLCWs, status reports
- PLCW (fixed‑length SPDU) → Expedited QoS, reports on Sequence Controlled frames.
- Variable‑length SPDUs → supervisory containers; QoS is chosen per use case, not fixed by their length.

PLCW
- specific protocol data unit used "for reporting sequence controlled service 


## Putting it together
- the vehicle controller configures the link and reacts to notifications
- MAC / Session & state control owns the state/operational variables, timers, duplex logic, and interacts with the physical layer
- directives + supervisory PDUs carry control information (local and remote) encoded using the variable-length supervisory formats
- COP-P (FOP-P/FARM-P) provides reliable delivery on top of frames using those variables and MIB parameters
- MIB is the parameter store that tunes all behavior
- physical + coding & sync are the radio and coding machinery at the bottom

## Nesting summary
- Physical bits -> PLTU (ASM + Transfer Frame + CRC)
- Inside PLTU: one transfer frame
- Inside Transfer Frame data field: one SPDU
